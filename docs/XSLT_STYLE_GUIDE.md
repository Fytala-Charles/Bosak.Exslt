## 1. XSLT File Rules

### 1.1 File Header

Every `.xsl` file begins with an XML comment before the `xsl:stylesheet` element
carrying at minimum these markers (see `src/strings.xsl` for the canonical shape):

```
AUTHOR, CREATE DATE, PURPOSE, SPECIAL NOTES, COPYRIGHT (Fytala), LICENSE (Apache-2.0)
```

`tools/check-docs.ps1` checks for the AUTHOR / PURPOSE / LICENSE markers in every
`src/**/*.xsl` file and that the file is well-formed XML. When modifying an existing
file, append a change-history entry with the current date, a bumped version, and a
brief note.

### 1.2 Function Doc Blocks

Every `xsl:function` that implements (or wraps) an EXSLT function is preceded by a
comment block covering:

1. **Purpose** — what the function computes, in one or two sentences.
2. **Parameters and return** — types and semantics, including EXSLT edge cases
   (e.g. `date:*` returning `NaN`/`''` on invalid input).
3. **Error/edge posture** — what happens on empty input, missing arguments,
   invalid values.
4. **Tier** — tier 1 wrappers state the native XPath 3.1 equivalent by name;
   tier 2 implementations note where semantics are exact vs. documented-divergent;
   tier 3 slots carry the terminating-message contract.
5. **Migration pointer** (tier 1) — the native form to use when modernizing.

Private helpers (`str:replace-scan`, `date:_parse-duration`) need shorter blocks:
purpose, parameters, and any non-obvious invariant.

### 1.3 Language Rules

- Standard XSLT 3.0 / XPath 3.1 + F&O only. No vendor extensions, no processor
  conditionals. Engine workarounds must be standards-compliant and noted in
  `SPECIAL NOTES` or the function's doc block as a "candidate core bug/gap".
- English identifiers and comments; `lower-case-with-hyphens` for EXSLT function
  names (they are fixed by the spec); `kebab-case` private helpers with a leading
  underscore for module-internal utilities.
- Two-space indentation in `.xsl` / `.xml` files (enforced by `.editorconfig`).
- `version="3.0"` on every `xsl:stylesheet`; declare namespaces on the stylesheet
  element and list non-output prefixes in `exclude-result-prefixes`.

## 2. Test Fixture Rules

- **Layout:** `tests/cases/<namespace>/<case>/` with `transform.xsl`, exactly one of
  `expected.xml` / `expected.txt`, `meta.json`, and optionally `input.xml`.
- **`meta.json` shape:**

```json
{
  "function": "math:min",
  "namespace": "http://exslt.org/math",
  "tier": 1,
  "source": { "project": "libxslt", "license": "MIT", "path": "tests/exslt/math/min.1" },
  "adaptations": "what was changed relative to upstream",
  "notes": "optional: divergences, engine-bug context"
}
```

  `source` is mandatory for imported fixtures (project, license, upstream path);
  hand-written cases use `"source": { "project": "hand-written", "license": "Apache-2.0" }`.
- **Provenance:** every imported fixture is recorded in its `meta.json` *and* in
  [`tests/ATTRIBUTION.md`](../tests/ATTRIBUTION.md) (project, license, upstream path;
  the attribution file carries the verbatim upstream license notice). Never fabricate
  attribution.
- **Divergence:** when a golden is re-goldened because the implementation
  deliberately diverges from libxslt, record it in the case's `meta.json` `notes`,
  [`tests/ATTRIBUTION.md`](../tests/ATTRIBUTION.md), and
  [`COMPATIBILITY.md`](./COMPATIBILITY.md) — in the same step. A golden
  may only be *changed* (never deleted) this way.
- **Include path:** case transforms include library modules via
  `../../../src/<module>.xsl` (three levels up from the case directory).
- **Training sessions** (`training/NN-slug/`) are fixtures for learners, not golden
  cases: `case/meta.json` uses the same shape with
  `"source": { "project": "hand-written", "license": "Apache-2.0" }` and a `notes`
  field marking the case as training material. Session transforms (`starter/`,
  `solution/`) are **self-contained** — they never include `src/`; the library is
  referenced only in lesson prose, as read-along material. Training cases are
  exercised by `training/TrainingTests/`, never by the golden harness.
- **XPath training sessions** (`training/xpath/NN-slug/`) follow the same rules
  with `starter|solution/exercise.xpath` (exactly one pure XPath 3.1 expression,
  no XSLT instructions or extension functions) and text goldens
  (`case/expected.txt`). The harness renders results as a token stream
  (`value | value | …`, `()` for the empty sequence).
